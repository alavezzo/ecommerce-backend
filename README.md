  ## Description
  This app uses MySql Express and Sequelize to create, update, read, and delete product data for a ecommerce website. It only contains backend code and the apiRoutes were tested using Insomnia.  
  ## Instructions
  Clone down the repo, connect to the server, and test those routes!
  ## Usage
  1. Run npm i to install all dependencies. 
  2. Create a database in sql to store your company data. 
  3. Utilize a .env file to connect this database to sequelize. 
  4. Set force to true and connect to server and sequelize will create necessary tables. 
  5. Disconnect from server and run npm seed to seed your newly created tables. 
  6. Set force to false and reconnect to server.
